# Color-game

This is a very easy to play Color Game.

The way you play it is you are given an RGB value, and depending on the mode you choose you will be displayed a number of squares. 
You have to correctly guess which square matches the RGB value. 


First steps:

	- create a html file layout with 3 sections(top-header, middle-content,bottom-footer)
	- in the top section the RGB value will be displayed (hard-coded at first)
	- in the middle section you will have,two sections
		- one section for actions 
			- Start new game
		- one section for colour squares (6 hard-coded colors to start with)
	- in the footer section - display the version number of the application
   
Second steps:

	- create a css file
	- be creative - style the application as you choose
